# Codex Rust Engineering Reference

## Purpose

This directory is a codex-only engineering reference based on
`.cache/researcher/openai/codex/`.

It captures reusable practices in Rust architecture, CI, security, and release
operations without project-specific implementation plans.

## Document Map

1. `00-research-method-and-scope.md`
   - Study method, source boundaries, and evidence rules.
2. `01-codex-engineering-patterns.md`
   - High-value engineering patterns extracted from codex sources.
3. `07-evidence-metrics-snapshot-2026-02-18.md`
   - Codex-only metrics and reproducible command fragments.

## How To Use

1. Read `00-research-method-and-scope.md` to understand what was measured.
2. Use `01-codex-engineering-patterns.md` as a pattern catalog.
3. Validate assumptions against `07-evidence-metrics-snapshot-2026-02-18.md`.

## Maintenance Rules

- Keep this directory English-only.
- Keep this directory codex-only (no project-specific gap analysis or roadmap).
- Update metrics snapshot when codex source snapshots change.
