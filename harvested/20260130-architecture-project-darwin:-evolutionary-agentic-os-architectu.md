# Project Darwin: The Evolutionary Agentic OS

## 1. Vision

Transform `omni-dev-fusion` into a self-evolving Agentic Operating System by integrating state-of-the-art research from AIOS, OS-Copilot, and GEA.

## 2. Theoretical Pillars

### 2.1 Kernel Layer: AIOS (LLM Agent Operating System)

- **Core Concept**: Define the LLM as the OS **CPU (Brain)**, and encapsulate traditional OS resources (files, processes, network) into a **Hypervisor/Abstraction Layer (HAL)**.
- **Omni Implementation**: `OmniCell` (Nushell/Rust Bridge) serves as the Micro-Kernel, isolating System Calls and providing structured resource access.
- **Evolution Path**: Implement **Context Scheduling**. Just as an OS schedules CPU cycles, the Kernel must schedule the LLM's Context Window, pruning irrelevant information to maximize cognitive density.

### 2.2 Evolutionary Layer: OS-Copilot (FRIDAY Agent)

- **Core Concept**: **Self-Directed Learning**. The agent generates its own curriculum to learn unfamiliar software/APIs and consolidates successful operations into reusable tools.
- **Omni Implementation**: **Skill Crystallization**. When the `Universal Solver` solves a novel problem (e.g., "batch convert webp to png"), it shouldn't just finish; it should synthesize a new `Python Skill` and persist it to `assets/skills/learned/`.

### 2.3 Architecture Layer: GEA (Generalist-Expert Architecture)

- **Core Concept**: **Mixture of Experts (MoE)** for Agents.
  - **Generalist**: Handles routing, planning, and long-tail/unknown tasks (ReAct loop).
  - **Expert**: Highly optimized atomic capabilities (Git, Research, Testing) for high-frequency tasks.
- **Omni Mapping**:
  - **Router**: The Manager/Dispatcher.
  - **Universal Solver**: The Generalist (Adaptive).
  - **Existing Skills**: The Experts (Deterministic/Optimized).

## 3. Implementation Roadmap

### Stage 1: Cognitive Kernel (Perception)

- **Status**: _In Progress (OmniCell)_
- **Goal**: Upgrade `OmniCell` from a "blind executor" to a "semantic filter".
- **Key Features**:
  - **Smart Query**: `query_structured(source, filter)` - Query the OS like a database rather than dumping raw text.
  - **Context Pruning**: Rust-based token counting and semantic truncation for CLI outputs (e.g., `ls` on large dirs).

### Stage 2: The Adaptive Generalist (Resilience)

- **Status**: _Design Phase_
- **Goal**: Create a fallback execution node that ensures the agent never hits a dead end.
- **Key Features**:
  - **Universal Solver Node**: A LangGraph node activated when `Router` returns no specific skill.
  - **Dynamic Plan Generation**: LLM writes ephemeral Nushell scripts based on real-time `sys_ops` feedback.
  - **Self-Correction Loop**: Execute -> Catch Stderr -> Refine Script -> Retry.

### Stage 3: Evolutionary Memory (Growth)

- **Status**: _Future_
- **Goal**: System capabilities grow linearly with usage time.
- **Key Features**:
  - **Trace Compiler**: Monitor `Universal Solver` success traces.
  - **Auto-Coding**: Promote high-frequency traces into permanent `Omni Skill` (Python Classes).
  - **Skill Injection**: Automated Git PRs to merge learned skills into the codebase.
